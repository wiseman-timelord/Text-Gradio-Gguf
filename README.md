## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 - Its a Windows program, it may be linux compatible later (not now).
- Llama.Cpp - Options here for, Avx2, Vulkan, Kompute, Cuda 11, Cuda 12.
- Python => 3.8 - Libraries used = Gradio, LangChain, llama-cpp-python, FAISS.
- Llm Model - You will need a Large Language Model in GGUF format, See below

### Instructions
1. Download a "Release" version, when its available, and unpack to a sensible directory, like, `C:\Program_Filez\Text-Gradio-Gguf` or `C:\Programs\Text-Gradio-Gguf`. 
2. Right click the file `Text-Gradio-Gguf.bat`, and `Run as Admin`, the Batch Menu will then load.
3. Select `2` from the Batch Menu, to begin installation.
4. you will be prompted to select a Llama.Cpp version to install, which should be done based on your hardware.
5. After which, the install will begin, wherein Python requirements will install to a `.\venv` folder.
6. After the install completes, check for any install issues, you may need to install again if there are.
7. You will then be returned to the Batch Menu, where you, now and in future, select `1` to run to run `Text-Gradio-Gguf`.
8. You will be greeted with the conversation page, but you will first be going to the configuration page.
9. On the `Configuration` page you would configure appropriately, its all straight forwards.
10. Go back to the `Conversation` page and begin interactions, ensuring to notice features available.

### Notation
- Tabs on left of `Chat` page; "Start New Session" at top, 10-session limit.
- Auto-labeled sessions (e.g., "Query about worms") stored in `.\data\history\*`.
- VRAM dropdown, 1GB to 32GB in steps, this should be your FREE ram available on the selected card.
- We use `(ModelFileSize * 1.1875) / NumLayers = LayerSize`, then `TotalVRam / LayerSize = NumLayersOnGpu`.
- Most GGUF text models will work, keep in mind the applicable keywords shown in `Model Label Keywords` section.
- If you like using LLMs on your own hardware, then you will probably like my program [DownLord](https://github.com/wiseman-timelord/DownLord).

### Model label/name Keywords...
1. Keywords for Operation mode...
- `Coding` keywords - "code", "coder", "program", "dev", "copilot", "codex", "Python", "Powershell".
- `RPG Game` keywords - "nsfw", "adult", "mature", "explicit", "rp", "roleplay".
- `Chat` keywords - none of the above.
2. Keywords for Enhancements...
- `UnCensored` keywords - "uncensored", "unfiltered", "unbiased", "unlocked".
- `reasoning` keywords - "reason", "r1", "think".

# Models
You will of course need to have a `*.Gguf` model for anything to work, here are the models used to test the program.. 
1. For ~8B models (Primary/Quality).
- [qwen2.5-7b-cabs-v0.4-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/qwen2.5-7b-cabs-v0.4-GGUF) - Best <8b Model on General leaderboard, and ~500 overall.
- Choice between, Llama [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Uncensored-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Uncensored-GGUF) and Qwen [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B-Uncensored-Reasoner-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B-Uncensored-Reasoner-GGUF) , versions of R1 - Uncensored <8GB, Chat and Reasoning.

2. For <4B models (Secondary/Fast).
- [Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-uncensored-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-uncensored-GGUF) - untested.

## Development
- UI and general design done, need to bugfix and complete now, est 90% done or more.

## Far Development.
- the next generation of the program will be 6 modes and dual model like this...
```
| **Mode**             | **Models**                     | **Features**                                      | **Implementation Notes**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chatbot              | Single chat model (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) | TOT reasoning, web research                     | Use LangChain for TOT (e.g., recursive prompt splitting), SerpAPI for web queries       |
| Advanced Chatbot     | Fast + Quality chat models    | TOT on Fast, AUTO/FAST/QUALITY switch, web on Fast | Quantize Fast model (e.g., 4-bit), add Gradio slider for mode, cache Quality outputs   |
| Coder                | Single code model (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder) | Syntax, formatting, completion                | Leverage Pygments for highlighting, integrate VSCode-like keybinds                     |
| Agentic Coder        | Code + text models            | Intent → code → review loop                    | Chain via LangChain agents, store intermediate states in .\data\                       |
| RPG Text             | Single RPG model              | Narrative, character tracking, uncensored       | Parse entities with regex, save JSON states in .\data\history\                         |
| RPG Text + Images    | RPG + image model (Flux.1-schnell) | Text RPG + scene images                      | Trigger Flux via llama.cpp image fork, display in Gradio gallery (256x256 max)         |
```
- Introduction of `Text-Gradio-Gguf.sh` file and modifications of scripts, to enable, Linux AND Windows, support. 
- Verbose Clear Concise Printed Notifications for all stages of model interaction/json handling: `Sending Prompt to Code Model...`, `Generating Code for Chat Model...`, `Response Received from Code Model...`.
- Color themes. Deepseek R1 AND Grok3Beta, found this extremely difficult, Deepseek was better. It needs to be re-attempted later, possibly with GPT4o1. Make it all shades of grey, then allow people to choose the primary button color in configuration, or something simple like that.
- two new modes—Chat-Notate and Chat-Notate-Uncensored—to your Windows 10-based chatbot. These modes allow the AI to process uploaded PDFs into summarized notations, stored in .\data\notation, with two versions: a detailed summary (up to the model's context limit, minus a safety margin) and a concise summary (256 tokens). During chats, the AI selects the most relevant detailed notation based on user input to deliver informed responses. A Notation Library menu in the UI enables users to manage notations by indexing new PDFs or deleting existing ones. For reasoning models in these modes, the THINK phase is disabled (like in TOT mode), ensuring practical, notation-driven conversations. This feature is slated for a later development phase.
