## Description
A high-quality chat interface optimized for GGUF models, designed for efficiency and usability. The configuration is tailored to community reported effectiveness, while configurations that often make no difference are ignored, ensuring a comprehensive yet streamlined experience. With the latest advancements in GGUF models, such as the models found in the `Links` section. This tool eliminates the need for online chatbots while providing local, uncensored, and efficient inference. The interface is designed to evolve with additional features that enhance productivity and usability. The main concept is, to download the best smaller models on HuggingFace, and use them, without the restrictions and with comparable interface, found on premium AI services.

### Features
- **Uncensored Efficiency**: Optimized for GGUF, auto-calculating layers, dependent on, model details and Free VRam.
- **GPU Support**: Compatible with AMD/NVIDIA/Intel GPUs via Vulkan/Kompute/Cuda/Avx2, with GPU selection dropdown.
- **Research-Grade Tools**: Includes RAG, web search, chunking, summarization, and code formatting.
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python setup in `.venv` with `models` and `data` directories.
- **Simplified File Support**: Handles `.bat`, `.py`, `.ps1`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.psd1`, `.xaml` files.
- **Configurable Context Window**: Set `n_ctx` to 8192, 16384, 24576, or 32768 via dropdown.
- **Enhanced Interface Controls**: Load/unload models, manage sessions, shutdown, and configure settings.
- **Token Streaming**: Real-time token generation for seamless chat interactions.
- **Model Selection**: Dropdown lists GGUF models from `.\models\*.gguf` for easy switching.
- **Auto-Model Handle**: Uses hotwords in model name, to better handle, ctx, temperature, modes, prompts, etc.
- **FAISS Vector Database**: Stores numerical vectors, and retrieves based on proximity in meaning, enabling pulling context from documents.

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 - Its a Windows program, it may be linux compatible later (not now).
- Llama.Cpp - Options here for, Avx2, Vulkan, Kompute, Cuda 11, Cuda 12.
- Python => 3.8 - Libraries used = Gradio, LangChain, llama-cpp-python, FAISS.

### Instructions
1. Download a "Release" version, when its available, and unpack to a sensible directory, like, `C:\Program_Filez\Chat-Gradio-Gguf` or `C:\Programs\Chat-Gradio-Gguf`. 
2. Right click the file `Chat-Gradio-Gguf.bat`, and `Run as Admin`, the Batch Menu will then load.
3. Select `2` from the Batch Menu, to begin installation.
4. you will be prompted to select a Llama.Cpp version to install, which should be done based on your hardware.
5. After which, the install will begin, wherein Python requirements will install to a `.\venv` folder.
6. After the install completes, check for any install issues, you may need to install again if there are.
7. You will then be returned to the Batch Menu, where you, now and in future, select `1` to run to run `Chat-Gradio-Gguf`.
 
### Notation
- Tabs on left of `Chat` page; "Start New Session" at top, 10-session limit.
- Auto-labeled sessions (e.g., "Query about worms") stored in `.\data\history\*`.
- Vulkan/Kompute supports all GPUs; optimized for non-ROCM AMD without extras.
- You will of course need to have a `*.Gguf` model in `.\models`, in order for anything to work.
- VRAM dropdown, 1GB to 32GB in steps, this should be your FREE ram on the selected card.
- Settings tab offers temperature (-1 to 1) and VRAM options via dropdowns.
- We use `(ModelFileSize * 1.25) / NumLayers = LayerSize`, then `TotalVRam / LayerSize = NumLayersOnGpu`.
- Result is rounded to a whole number for GPU layer offloading in the load model command.
- 9 "History Slots" and "6 File Slots", seemed, like sensible numbers and to fit the display.

### Models
Advised models in, 14B, ~8B, 3B, require relevantly, ~11GB, ~7GB, ~3GB, they are all reletively fast.
- [Lamarckvergence-14B-Gguf](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Lamarckvergence-14B-GGUF) - Best <15b Model at at the time in Gguf format, filename `Lamarckvergence-14B.Q6_K_M.gguf`.
- [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B-Uncensored-Reasoner-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B-Uncensored-Reasoner-GGUF) - Possibly good Uncensored Small Chat model in GGUF format, filename `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B-Uncensored-Reasoner.Q6_K.gguf`.
- [qwen2.5-7b-cabs-v0.4-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/qwen2.5-7b-cabs-v0.4-GGUF) - Best <8b Model at the time in Gguf format, filename `qwen2.5-7b-cabs-v0.4.Q6_K.gguf`.
- [Nxcode-CQ-7B-orpol-Gguf](https://huggingface.co/tensorblock/Nxcode-CQ-7B-orpo-GGUF) - Best Python code model  at the time in GGUF format, filename `Nxcode-CQ-7B-orpo.Q6_K.gguf`.
- [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Uncensored-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Uncensored-GGUF) - Interesting Uncensored <8GB Chat model in GGUF format, filename `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Uncensored.Q6_K.gguf`.
- [Llama-3.2-3b-NSFW_Aesir_Uncensored-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Novaciano/Llama-3.2-3b-NSFW_Aesir_Uncensored-GGUF) - Tested and somewhat good, fast Nsfw Chat model in GGUF format, filename `Llama-3.2-3b-NSFW_Aesir_Uncensored.gguf`.
- [Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-uncensored-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-uncensored-GGUF) - Looks like a great model for text processing/secondary model, filename `Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-uncensored-Q3_K_M.gguf`.

## Development
- Testing and Bugfixing - keep testing, while keeping an eye on the terminal for output of, warnings and errors, then find fixes, and a few, refinements or improvements, along the way.
- Status page possibly needs to be, at the top or at the bottom, of both pages. I should do some research specifically upon Chatbot interfaces, and determine how to improve the layout optimally.

### Far Development.
- If there is some small 1B model, we could download and use, to create the session history label for the session, then this would be better, than the user having to wait for whatever more capable model is doing, so as to produce quick labels for session history. preferably a <256MB download, and again, the context size is automatic based on the size of the first, input and response, but if it runs out of context, then we will cut it where it runs out, as for example, if we just have most of the users first input, then this should be good enough to create a unique 3 word label.
- Ongoing improvement of Gradio Interface required, until it "looks right". 
- Testing and bugfixing, required for all features of main program.
- Introduction of `Chat-Gradio-Gguf.sh` file and modifications of scripts, to enable, Linux AND Windows, support. 
- Agentic workflows, potentially using purpose built fine tuned models, for, thinking, interaction, or code. 
- There is also an idea of the `Performance` model and the `Quality` model, where the user could switch between, albeit this could also be, fast for simple tasks like creating the title of the session, and slow for interaction, or the likes.
- Verbose Clear Concise Printed Notifications for all stages of model interaction/json handling: `Sending Prompt to Code Model...`, `Generating Code for Chat Model...`, `Response Received from Code Model...`.
